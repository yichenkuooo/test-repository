  <h1> "Lana Turner has collapsed!"    <img src="smiley.gif" alt="Smiley face" style="float:right;width:150px;height:150px;">
  </h1>
  <h2  class = "paragraph"> Lana Turner has collapsed!  I was trotting along and suddenly
    it started raining and snowing
    
    and <a href="p2.html"> YOU </a> <!--LinkPage--> said it was hailing

    <img src="P1.gif" alt="Yellow Drop" style="width:950px;height:650px;">

    but hailing hits <a href="p2.html"> YOU </a> <!--LinkPage--> on the head
    hard so it was really snowing and
    raining and I was in such a hurry
    to meet <a href="p2.html"> YOU </a> <!--LinkPage--> but the traffic
    was acting exactly like the sky
    and suddenly I see a headline
    lana turner has collapsed!

    
    there is no snow in Hollywood
    there is no rain in California
    I have been to lots of parties
    and acted perfectly disgraceful
    but I never actually collapsed
    oh Lana Turner we love <a href="p2.html"> YOU </a> <!--LinkPage--> get up. <p>
